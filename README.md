Classification Model with scikit-learn

Objective

The objective of this project is to build a classification model using scikit-learn to predict a binary outcome based on a dataset and evaluate the model's performance.

Dataset

You can choose a dataset from sklearn's built-in datasets or select one from a reliable source. Ensure that the dataset contains both features and a binary target variable (e.g., 0 or 1, Yes or No, etc.).

Data Loading

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame (if not using a built-in sklearn dataset). Display the first few rows to get a sense of the data.

Data Preprocessing

Perform necessary data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (if any), and scaling/normalizing numerical features.

Data Splitting

Split the dataset into two parts: a training set (70-80% of the data) and a testing set (20-30% of the data).

Model Selection

Choose at least two classification algorithms from sklearn (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc.). Train each model on the training data.

Model Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of each model on the testing set using appropriate classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Compare the performance of the models and discuss which one performs better.

Cross-Validation

Implement cross-validation to assess the model's stability and generalization performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)

If time permits, perform hyperparameter tuning on one of the models to see if you can improve its performance. Use techniques like GridSearchCV or Randomized SearchCV for this.


Conclusion

Summarize your findings. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the models you tested. Reflect on the importance of data preprocessing in model performance.


Submission Guidelines

Submit a Jupyter Notebook or a Python script that includes the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and any optional hyperparameter tuning.

Include visualizations (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve) to support your model evaluations.

Write clear and concise explanations for each step of the process.

Ensure that your code is well-documented and easy to follow.
